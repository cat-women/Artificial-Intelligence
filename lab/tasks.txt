1. Write a program to find the largest and smallest number in an array.
2. Write a program to sort an array of integers.
3. Write a program to find if a string is Palindrome.
4. Write a recursive program to find the factorial of a number.
5. Write a program to implement a linked list.
6. Write a function that combines two lists/arrays by alternatingly taking elements, e.g. [a,b,c], [1,2,3] â†’ [a,1,b,2,c,3].
7. Write a program to concatenate two arrays of integers and sort them.
